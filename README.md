# **dewloosh.plotly** - Domain specific data visualization with Plotly

This a lightweight library serving as a place to gather code snippets for
working with Plotly. The uses cases are usually domain specific, likely to be related
to other dewloosh projects.

## **Documentation**

Click [here](https://dewloosh-plotly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to read the documentation.

## **Installation**
This is optional, but we suggest you to create a dedicated virtual enviroment at all times to avoid conflicts with your other projects. Create a folder, open a command shell in that folder and use the following command

```console
>>> python -m venv venv_name
```

Once the enviroment is created, activate it via typing

```console
>>> .\venv_name\Scripts\activate
```

`latexdocs` can be installed (either in a virtual enviroment or globally) from PyPI using `pip` on Python >= 3.7:

```console
>>> pip install dewloosh.plotly
```
